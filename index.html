						<p class="text-lg paragraph">
							Toilet paper orientation has been a contentious issue as long as toilet
							paper has been around. However, many do not know of the Toilet Paper
							Battle of 1899. One day, the general of the United States Army was using
							the bathroom and decided that the correct orientation of toilet paper
							was the over orientation. He brought this point to president William
							McKinley, but McKinley hated the idea so much that he declared that
							every American citizen was legally required to attack him. In the
							insuing battle, the general was killed, but his followers would get
							their revenge in 1901 with the assassination of McKinley.

							The Mystery of the Golden Toilet Paper
						</h2>
						<p class="text-lg paragraph">
							There are many historical artifacts of the golden age of toilet paper
							that remain lost to us today. In fact, the most important toilet paper
							relic still remains hidden. The Golden Toilet Paper was created in 1453
							after the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottoman Empire. Sultan
							Mehmet II decided to create an artifact to represent his new power, and
							so logically, he decided to make a meter-wide roll of golden toilet
							paper. This golden toilet paper was infused with magic, and is thought
							to give anyone who uses it the ability to sneeze with a force of 1000
							psi. Will we ever discover this mysterious artifact? No one knows.

						<h2 class="text-2xl text-center m-5">The Invention of Toilet Paper</h2>
						<p class="text-lg paragraph">
							Toilet Paper was invented by the Tang Dynasty of China around 800 CE.
							This invention had an incredible effect on the lives of the people, as
							it allowed for incredible productivity due to people being cleaner.
							However, soon after this invention, a group of purists called the ATPA
							(Anti Toilet Paper Association) declared a cultural war on the
							progressive toiler paper advocates. This conflict almost led to civil
							war, but eventually the ATPA was convinced of the positive effects of
							toiler paper and war was averted.
